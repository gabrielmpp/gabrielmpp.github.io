Hi! I am a PhD student in Climate Science at the University of Reading, UK since 2018. My main interest is developing computational tools to help understanding and forecasting the Earth's atmosphere. More specifically, I have been looking at large-scale mechanisms of moisture transport and rainfall through a Lagrangian perspective. 

My BSc and MSc were in Meteorology at the University Sao Paulo, Brazil (USP). In my master's research, I developed a short-range rainfall forecast system using machine learning. Soon after my master's, I worked briefly in the private sector to deploy a similar system.
